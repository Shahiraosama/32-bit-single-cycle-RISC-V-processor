# 32-bit-single-cycle-RISC-V-processor
 32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture RISC-V processor based on Harvard Architecture. 
 The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words,
instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and programcounterupdate occurs within a single clock cycle.
The microprocessor was tested to execute  Fibonacci Series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ....).
